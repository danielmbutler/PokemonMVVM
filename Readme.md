# PokeDex App
An App to search a list of pokemon from the pokemon api, view their abilities, stats and see their last known location in the pokemon world. The list view show a list of pokemon which can be searched using the search bar or filters, from this view the map and saved screen can also be accessed, the map view shows the last known location of all pokemon that the app knows about, the saved view will contain any pokemon that you have saved to your deck. When clicking on the pokemon in the list view you will get taken to the detail screen this shows the card of the pokemon with a list of its abilites, stats, type, last know location and also a star rating which is calculated based on the average of all of the stats. This app periodically searches the pokemon api in the background even whilst the app is not open to find new pokemon and add them to the internal database (this can be turned off from the settings icon on the list view).
